- main.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'main.py' contains the main Flask application and is the entry point of the program. It uses all the other modules to process the scene, recognize objects, answer questions, and update the scene.
        'scene_processor.py' is responsible for processing the scene description into a dictionary.
        'object_recognizer.py' uses the YOLOv4 model to recognize objects in the scene.
        'question_answerer.py' uses the GPT-3 model to answer questions based on the scene context.
        'scene_updater.py' is responsible for updating the scene with recognized objects.
