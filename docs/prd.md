## Original Requirements

Create an LLM-based software system which takes a scene description in JSON-format and then uses the YOLO algorithm to include objects into the scene. Based on the JSON scene + added context from YOLO, a user should be able to ask questions about the scene which is sent to an LLM. The LLM should understand the context of the items in the scene and answer the question. This then loops to constantly update the scene with existing items and is ready for user questions.

## Product Goals

- Efficient scene description processing
- Accurate object recognition using YOLO
- Effective question answering based on scene context

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to upload a scene description in JSON format
- As a user, I want the software to identify objects in the scene using YOLO
- As a user, I want to ask questions about the scene
- As a user, I want the software to answer my questions based on the scene context
- As a user, I want the scene to be constantly updated with identified objects

## Competitive Analysis

- Product A: Offers scene description processing but lacks object recognition
- Product B: Uses object recognition but doesn't support scene description in JSON format
- Product C: Supports question answering but not based on scene context
- Product D: Provides constant scene updates but lacks efficient processing
- Product E: Uses a different algorithm for object recognition, not as accurate as YOLO

## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to efficiently process scene descriptions in JSON format, accurately identify objects in the scene using YOLO, answer user questions based on the scene context, and constantly update the scene with identified objects.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Efficient scene description processing in JSON format']
- ['P0', 'Accurate object recognition using YOLO']
- ['P0', 'Effective question answering based on scene context']
- ['P1', 'Constant scene updates with identified objects']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be clean and intuitive, with a main area for displaying the scene and identified objects. There should be an upload button for users to upload their scene description in JSON format, and a text box for users to input their questions. The answers to the questions should be displayed in a dedicated area below the scene display.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific implementation of the LLM and how it interacts with the YOLO algorithm needs to be clarified.
