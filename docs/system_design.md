## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework to handle user inputs and outputs. For the scene description processing, we will use the json module in Python. For object recognition, we will use the open-source YOLOv4 implementation in Python. To answer questions based on scene context, we will use the open-source GPT-3 model from OpenAI. To constantly update the scene with identified objects, we will use a while loop in our main function that keeps running the YOLO and GPT-3 models on the scene.

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant SP as SceneProcessor
        participant OR as ObjectRecognizer
        participant QA as QuestionAnswerer
        participant SU as SceneUpdater
        M->>SP: process_scene(scene_description)
        SP-->>M: scene
        loop every few seconds
            M->>OR: recognize_objects(scene)
            OR-->>M: scene
            M->>SU: update_scene(scene)
            SU-->>M: scene
        end
        Note over M: User asks a question
        M->>QA: answer_question(question, scene)
        QA-->>M: answer
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
